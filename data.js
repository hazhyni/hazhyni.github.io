  heroDescription:
    "I’m a multidisciplinary professional with hands-on experience in software development, project operations, and academic research. With a background in Information Systems and technical expertise in Laravel, CodeIgniter, Bootstrap, and Android Studio, I have built applications from concept to deployment — including marketplace-style platforms and API-integrated dashboards. Professionally, I’ve served as a Project Control & Quality Control admin for large-scale ammonia tank construction, managing documentation, progress reporting, and cross-team coordination. In research, I’ve explored AI applications, circular economy, and crypto policy analysis using lexicon-based sentiment analysis, machine learning, and explainable AI (SHAP, LIME). I thrive at the intersection of technology, data, and business, and I’m eager to contribute to projects that drive measurable impact and innovation. I’m currently seeking opportunities to leverage my diverse skill set in software development, project management, and data analysis to create impactful solutions.",
